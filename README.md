# Diabetes_dataset_analysis
This repository contains a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) and statistical investigation of the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset. The objective is to understand the relationships between variables and identify patterns that distinguish diabetic from non-diabetic individuals.
Project Objectives
Data Inspection

Identify continuous and categorical variables.

Check for missing or anomalous values (e.g., 0 values in BMI or BloodPressure).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Boxplots, histograms, and violin plots to visualize distributions.

Identify and list outliers using boxplot.stats().

Normality Testing

Use the Shapiro-Wilk test to check normality of continuous variables.

Categorical Variable Exploration

Frequency and proportion visualization using bar plots and pie charts.

Relationship Analysis

Grouped boxplots to observe differences in variables based on diabetic status.

Model Evaluation

Simulate the test error distribution over 1000 replications.

Use K-Fold Cross Validation to compute average misclassification error.
